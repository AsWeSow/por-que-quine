## Privacy
Private messages are end-to-end encrypted, but message timestamps and the number of chats aren't. In a decentralized network this information is potentially available to anyone.

By looking at timestamps in chats, it is possible to guess who are chatting with each other. It is also possible, if not trivial, to find out who are communicating with each other by monitoring data subscriptions on the decentralized database.

In that regard, Iris prioritizes decentralization and availability over perfect privacy.

Profile names, photos and online status are currently public. That can be changed when advanced group permissions are developed.

The application is an unaudited proof-of-concept implementation, so don't use it for security critical purposes.
